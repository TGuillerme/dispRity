# The guts of the `dispRity` package

## Manipulating `dispRity` objects

Disparity analysis involves a lot of manipulation of many matrices (especially when bootstrapping) which can be impractical to visualise and will quickly overwhelm your `R` console.
Even the simple Beck and Lee 2014 example above produces an object with > 72 lines of lists of lists of matrices!

Therefore `dispRity` uses a specific class of object called a `dispRity` object.
These objects allow users to use S3 method functions such as `summary.dispRity`, `plot.dispRity` and `print.dispRity`. 
`dispRity` also contains various utility functions that manipulate the `dispRity` object (e.g. `sort.dispRity`, `extract.dispRity` see the full list in the next section).
These functions modify the `dispRity` object without having to delve into its complex structure!
The full structure of a `dispRity` object is detailed [here](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/blob/master/disparity_object.md).

```{r}
## Loading the example data
data(disparity)

## What is the class of the median_centroids object?
class(disparity)

## What does the object contain?
names(disparity)

## Summarising it using the S3 method print.dispRity
disparity
```

Note that it is always possible to recall the full object using the argument `all = TRUE` in `print.dispRity`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Display the full object
print(disparity, all = TRUE)
## This is more nearly ~ 5000 lines on my 13 inch laptop screen!
```

## `dispRity` utilities {#utilities}

The package also provides some utility functions to facilitate multidimensional analysis.

### `dispRity` object utilities  <a name="dispRity.utilities"></a>

The first set of utilities are functions for manipulating `dispRity` objects:

#### `make.dispRity`

This function creates empty `dispRity` objects.

```{r}
## Creating an empty dispRity object
make.dispRity()

## Creating an "empty" dispRity object with a matrix
(disparity_obj <- make.dispRity(matrix(rnorm(20), 5, 4)))
```

####  `fill.dispRity`

This function initialises a `dispRity` object and generates its call properties.

```{r}
## The dispRity object's call is indeed empty
disparity_obj$call

## Filling an empty disparity object (that needs to contain at least a matrix)
(disparity_obj <- fill.dispRity(disparity_obj))

## The dipRity object has now the correct minimal attributes
disparity_obj$call
```

####  `get.matrix`

This function extracts a specific matrix from a disparity object.
The matrix can be one of the bootstrapped matrices or/and a rarefied matrix.

```{r}
## Extracting the matrix containing the coordinates of the elements at time 50
str(get.matrix(disparity, "50"))

## Extracting the 3rd bootstrapped matrix with the 2nd rarefaction level
## (15 elements) from the second group (80 Mya)
str(get.matrix(disparity, subsets = 1, bootstrap = 3, rarefaction = 2))
```


#### `n.subsets`

This function simply counts the number of subsets in a `dispRity` object.


```{r}
## How many subsets are in this object?
n.subsets(disparity)
```

#### `name.subsets`

This function gets you the names of the subsets in a `dispRity` object as a vector.


```{r}
## What are they called?
name.subsets(disparity)
```

#### `size.subsets`

This function tells the number of elements in each subsets of a `dispRity` object.


```{r}
## How many elements are there in each subset?
size.subsets(disparity)
```

#### `get.subsets`

This function creates a dispRity object that contains only elements from one specific subsets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Extracting all the data for the crown mammals
(crown_mammals <- get.subsets(disp_crown_stemBS, "Group.crown"))

## The object keeps the properties of the parent object but is composed of only one subsets
length(crown_mammals$subsets)
```

#### `combine.subsets`

This function allows to merge different subsets.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Combine the two first subsets in the dispRity data example
combine.subsets(disparity, c(1,2))
```

Note that the computed values (bootstrapped data + disparity metric) are not merge.

#### `get.disparity`

This function extracts the calculated disparity values of a specific matrix.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Extracting the observed disparity (default)
get.disparity(disparity)

## Extracting the disparity from the bootstrapped values from the
## 10th rarefaction level from the second subsets (80 Mya)
get.disparity(disparity, observed = FALSE, subsets = 2, rarefaction = 10)
```

#### `rescale.dispRity`

This is the modified S3 method for `scale` (scaling and/or centring) that can be applied to the disparity data of a `dispRity` object and can take optional arguments (for example the rescaling by dividing by a maximum value).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Getting the disparity values of the time subsets
head(summary(disparity))

## Scaling the same disparity values
head(summary(rescale.dispRity(disparity, scale = TRUE)))

## Scaling and centering:
head(summary(rescale.dispRity(disparity, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)))

## Rescaling the value by dividing by a maximum value
head(summary(rescale.dispRity(disparity, max = 10)))
```

#### `sort.dispRity`

This is the S3 method of `sort` for sorting the subsets alphabetically (default) or following a specific pattern.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Sorting the disparity subsets in inverse alphabetic order
head(summary(sort(disparity, decreasing = TRUE)))

## Customised sorting
head(summary(sort(disparity, sort = c(7, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6))))
```


#### `get.tree` `add.tree` and `remove.tree`

These functions allow to manipulate the potential tree components of `dispRity` objects.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Getting the tree component of a dispRity object
get.tree(disparity)

## Removing the tree
remove.tree(disparity)

## Adding a tree
add.tree(disparity, tree = BeckLee_tree)
```

Note that `get.tree` can also be used to extract trees from different subsets (custom or continuous/discrete subsets).

For example, if we have three time bins like in the example below we have three time bins and we can extract the subtrees for these three time bins in different ways using the option `subsets` and `to.root`:

```{r}
## Load the Beck & Lee 2014 data
data(BeckLee_tree) ; data(BeckLee_mat99) ; data(BeckLee_ages)

## Time binning (discrete method)
## Generate two discrete time bins from 120 to 40 Ma every 20 Ma
time_bins <- chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree,
                            method = "discrete", time = c(120, 100, 80, 60),
                            inc.nodes = TRUE, FADLAD = BeckLee_ages)

## Getting the subtrees all the way to the root
root_subsets <- get.tree(time_bins, subsets = TRUE)

## Plotting the bin contents
old_par <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(BeckLee_tree, main = "original tree", show.tip.label = FALSE)
axisPhylo()
abline(v = BeckLee_tree$root.time - c(120, 100, 80, 60))
for(i in 1:3) {
     plot(root_subsets[[i]], main = names(root_subsets)[i],
          show.tip.label = FALSE)
     axisPhylo()
}
par(old_par)
```

But we can also extract the subtrees containing only branch lengths for the actual bins using `to.root = FALSE`:

```{r}
## Getting the subtrees all the way to the root
bin_subsets <- get.tree(time_bins, subsets = TRUE, to.root = FALSE)

## Plotting the bin contents
old_par <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(BeckLee_tree, main = "original tree", show.tip.label = FALSE)
axisPhylo()
abline(v = BeckLee_tree$root.time - c(120, 100, 80, 60))
for(i in 1:3) {
     plot(bin_subsets[[i]], main = names(bin_subsets)[i],
          show.tip.label = FALSE)
     axisPhylo()
}
par(old_par)
```

This can be useful for example for calculating the branch lengths in each bin:

```{r}
## How many cumulated phylogenetic diversity in each bin?
lapply(bin_subsets, function(tree) sum(tree$edge.length))
```

## The `dispRity` object content {#disprity-object}

The functions above are utilities to easily and safely access different elements in the `dispRity` object.
Alternatively, of course, each elements can be accessed manually.
Here is an explanation on how it works.
The `dispRity` object is a `list` of two to four elements, each of which are detailed below:

 * `$matrix`: an object of class `list` that contains at least one object of class `matrix`: the full multidimensional space.
 * `$call`: an object of class `list` containing information on the `dispRity` object content.
 * `$subsets`: an object of class `list` containing the subsets of the multidimensional space.
 * `$disparity`: an object of class `list` containing the disparity values.

The `dispRity` object is loosely based on `C` structure objects.
In fact, it is composed of one unique instance of a matrix (the multidimensional space) upon which the metric function is called via "pointers" to only a certain number of elements and/or dimensions of this matrix.
This allows for: (1) faster and easily tractable execution time: the metric functions are called through apply family function and can be parallelised; and (2) a really low memory footprint: at any time, only one matrix (or list of matrices) is present in the `R` environment rather than multiple copies of it for each subset.

### `$matrix`

This is the multidimensional space, stored in the `R` environment as a `list` object containing one or more `matrix` objects.
Each `matrix` requires row names but not column names (optional).
By default, if the row names are missing, `dispRity` function will arbitrarily generate them in numeric order (i.e. `rownames(matrix) <- 1:nrow(matrix)`).
This element of the `dispRity` object is never modified.

### `$call`

This element contains the information on the `dispRity` object content.
It is a `list` that can contain the following:

 * `$call$subsets`: a vector of `character` with information on the subsets type (either `"continuous"`, `"discrete"` or `"custom"`), their eventual model (`"acctran"`, `"deltran"`, `"random"`, `"proximity"`, `"equal.split"`, `"gradual.split"`) and eventual information about the trees and matrices used through `chrono.subsets`. This element generated only once via `chrono.subsets()` and `custom.subsets()`.
 * `$call$dimensions`: either a single `numeric` value indicating how many dimensions to use or a vector of `numeric` values indicating which specific dimensions to use. This element is by default the number of columns in `$matrix` but can be modified through `boot.matrix()` or `dispRity()`.
 * `$call$bootstrap`: this is a `list` containing three elements:
    * `[[1]]`: the number of bootstrap replicates (`numeric`)
    * `[[2]]`: the bootstrap method (`character`)
    * `[[3]]`: the rarefaction levels (`numeric` vector)
 * `$call$disparity`: this is a `list` containing one element, `$metric`, that is a `list` containing the different functions passed to the `metric` argument in `dispRity`. These are `call` elements and get modified each time the `dispRity` function is used (the first element is the first metric(s), the second, the second metric(s), etc.).

### `$subsets`

This element contain the eventual subsets of the multidimensional space.
It is a `list` of subset names.
Each subset name is in turn a `list` of at least one element called `elements` which is in turn a `matrix`.
This `elements` matrix is the raw (observed) elements in the subsets.
The `elements` matrix is composed of `numeric` values in one column and _n_ rows (the number of elements in the subset).
Each of these values are a "pointer" (`C` inspired) to the element of the `$matrix`.
For example, lets assume a `dispRity` object called `disparity`, composed of at least one subsets called `sub1`:

```
 disparity$subsets$sub1$elements
      [,1]
 [1,]    5
 [2,]    4
 [3,]    6
 [4,]    7
```

The values in the matrix "point" to the elements in `$matrix`: here, the multidimensional space with only the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th elements.
The following elements in `diparity$subsets$sub1` will correspond to the same "pointers" but drawn from the bootstrap replicates.
The columns will correspond to different bootstrap replicates.
For example:

```
 disparity$subsets$sub1[[2]]
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
 [1,]   57   43   70    4
 [2,]   43   44    4    4
 [3,]   42   84   44    1
 [4,]   84    7    2   10
```
This signifies that we have four bootstrap pseudo-replicates pointing each time to four elements in `$matrix`.
The next element (`[[3]]`) will be the same for the eventual first rarefaction level (i.e. the resulting bootstrap matrix will have _m_ rows where _m_ is the number of elements for this rarefaction level).
The next element after that (`[[4]]`) will be the same for with an other rarefaction level and so forth...

When a probabilistic model was used to select the elements (models that have the `"split"` suffix, e.g. `chrono.subsets(..., model = "gradual.split")`), the `$elements` is a matrix containing a pair of elements of the matrix and a probability for sampling the first element in that list:

```
 disparity$subsets$sub1$elements
      [,1] [,2]       [,3]
 [1,]   73   36 0.01871893
 [2,]   74   37 0.02555876
 [3,]   33   38 0.85679821
```

In this example, you can read the table row by row as: "there is a probability of `0.018` for sampling element `73` and a probability of `0.82` (`1-0.018`) of sampling element `36`".

### `$disparity`

The `$disparity` element is identical to the `$subsets` element structure (a list of list(s) containing matrices) but the matrices don't contain "pointers" to `$matrix` but the disparity result of the disparity metric applied to the "pointers".
For example, in our first example (`$elements`) from above, if the disparity metric is of dimensions level 1, we would have:

```
 disparity$disparity$sub1$elements
      [,1]
 [1,]    1.82
```

This is the observed disparity (1.82) for the subset called `sub1`.
If the disparity metric is of dimension level 2 (say the function `range` that outputs two values), we would have:

```
 disparity$disparity$sub1$elements
      [,1]
 [1,]    0.82
 [2,]    2.82
```

The following elements in the list follow the same logic as before: rows are disparity values (one row for a dimension level 1 metric, multiple for a dimensions level 2 metric) and columns are the bootstrap replicates (the bootstrap with all elements followed by the eventual rarefaction levels).
For example for the bootstrap without rarefaction (second element of the list):

```
 disparity$disparity$sub1[[2]]
         [,1]     [,2]     [,3]     [,4]
[1,] 1.744668 1.777418 1.781624 1.739679 
```
