Description: this is a modulable package for calculating disparity in R. Disparity can be
	calculated from any ordinated matrix. Traditionally one ordinates cladistic or
	morphometric data but the package is not restrictive, ecological data or any other
	ordination can be used as well. The package provides a set of implemented metrics to
	measure the ordinated space and allows users to provide and test their own metrics (
	please share them!). The package also provides functions for looking at disparity in
	a serial way (e.g. time series) as well as visualising the results. Finally, this
	package provides several basic statistical test for disparity analysis.
